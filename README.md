# SW4P
SW4P is a shooter where your main goal is to clear an area of all enemies. Spawning without weapons, you take control of enemies to gain an advantage of your targets.

Welcome to the SW4P active development team! Setting up should be easy and you'll be able to be productive in just a few minutes, right?

WRONG, BITCH! WELCOME TO HELL.
What, did you seriously think this 10 million year old game was going to have a clean, maintainable codebase? Welcome to the obfuscated-single-Unreal-file-200-page pain zone friend!
What you're looking at is a concentrated effort of years of burnt out developers making your future life as painful, impossible and un-testable as they can. What's that, you want some actual advice on the codebase? Yeah, open that shit right up and go ahead, I'll wait.
Or, not, because by the time you're done understanding it I'll be fucking dead. What's that sound? You're regretting not joining the art team instead? Understandable - sometimes I also want to leave this place to lovingly create innocent character designs and watch people make terrabytes of low quality porn of it the next day. 10/10.

Here's your setup guide:

Step 1: Find a loaded revolver

Step 2: Track down everyone responsible for this mess

Step 3: ???

Step 4: IT'S STILL BROKEN AS FUCK.

One time I changed the menu button color and it broke the collision system. What the fuck.

Anyway, that should get you going! If you have any questions, I suggest you pray for the sweet release of death.
